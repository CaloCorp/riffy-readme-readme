# Riffy README - README

### Introduction

What should your [Riffy](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/riffy) README look like, you ask? This README will answer all your README questions, in README form. (So read me!)


### Workflow

This part of your assignment will simply be the README for your app. So though it will be graded separately, it will be part of the same repo.


### Basic Format

Your readme should have some of the same material as your [proposal](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/riffy-proposal), so you can work off of that. But your app has most likely changed in scope since you began it, so you will now be updating it, and adding more, with the result being the following sections, in suggested but not required order. :

* A heading with the name of your app.
* App Summary (does NOT have to have its own heading, if you just want to have it follow your main heading). This should be user-facing; no technical terms or discussion of logic, just what your app does!
* Installing and Running - how can we set up and use your app? Tell them how to download (using GitHub's "Clone or Download" button) and how to run it using `node`. Link to an article about installing `node`, for those who don't have it.
* How To Use This App - what arguments does it take? Bonus points for screenshots of your app in action in the terminal!
* Technologies Used - for this app it will simply be JS and Node, but if you want to talk about particular techniques within JS or Node, or you used any outside resources, you should list those here as well.
* What I Learned While Making The App. (Self-explanatory?)


### What Might My Readme End Up Looking Like?
